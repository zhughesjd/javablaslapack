                       REQUIRED PACKAGES:
                       ------------------

The Open Fortran Parser (OFP) tools require ANTLR 3.3.
You can obtain ANTLR from http://antlr.org/.  OFP also
requires a Java installation.


               BEFORE YOU START TO COMPILE OFP:
               ----------------------------------

Assuming that you have downloaded the OFP distribution (from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/fortran-parser) and unpacked and untarred
it, there should be, at least, the following files and directories:

	configure ..................... used for Unix builds
	lib ........................... a pre-built OpenFortranParser-0.8.3.jar file
	test/ ......................... test files
	src/ .......................... the OFP source code


              UNIX CONFIGURE/COMPILE INSTRUCTIONS:
              ------------------------------------

The instructions for building OFP on all Unix platforms are the
same.  First, cd to the OFP top level directory and do the following:

1. Configure for your environment.  A convenient way to see the possible
   options is to type

	./configure --help

   The primary options are --enable-c-actions and --enable-c-main.  These
   are only needed if you wish build the action interfaces in C and are enabled
   by default.  Normally

        ./configure

   is sufficient for most users.  The --prefix option may be used to change
   the location of the install directory.

2. Run 'make' to build the OFP libraries.

   IMPORTANT NOTE: Because of a bug (we think) in antlr-3.3, the build
   reports an error a couple of times during the build process but continues
   to finish.  This is expected behavior.

4. Run 'make install' to install the OFP files under the location
   specified with the prefix configure option.  Note that you must have
   the necessary privileges to write to the install directory.


                          RUNNING OFP:
                          --------------

  - Run the parser with the command

         java fortran.ofp.FrontEnd [--verbose] filename

    Note that your Java CLASSPATH must include the OpenFortranParser-0.8.3.jar
    and the antlr-3.3-complete.jar files (see the README file).
